<h1>WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE</h1>
<h2>Naomi Peter Kuguru </h2>
<p>I have often heard a lot of people in Tanzania say that females always have the same boring<br>
life cycle...and i being as stubborn as i am i have never accepted that ridiculous ideology to<br>
be part of my future goal.</p> 
<p>Being part of the priveleged few percent of females in my country to reach a stage of higher<br> 
learning after working hard from primary,secondary,high school to university gives the courage<br>
to believe the saying <em><q>if there is a will there is a way</q>. </em></p>

<p>Despite every struggle i strictly  continue engaging my self with enterprenueship and i look<br> 
up to very big enterprenuers such as Mohamed Dewji.</p>
